If you're reading this - hi there ðŸ‘‹, you've found the repo for my personal site. This isn't some technical masterpiece, just a site I 
hacked together to support hosting a blog without having to manage a backend. This probably won't be seeing many updates (except for adding markdown blog posts)

#### Tech Stack
This website uses React & NextJS in TypeScript, as well as the [React95 Project](https://github.com/React95/React95). Deployments are automated using the Vercel integration with GitHub Actions.

##### Why these Technologies?
* React - It's the standard for modern web dev.
* NextJS - Wanted to use SSR for blog posts that I could write in Markdown, as well as simply learn Next.
* React95 - Why wouldn't I? React95 is great.
* Vercel - It integrates very nicely into the GitHub ecosystem and makes deployments a breeze, and is very cost-effective.
