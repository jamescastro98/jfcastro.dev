Well, long time without an update and a full website redesign later and - here we are.

It's been a great two and a half years since I've last written a blog post, and I think it's about time to write a new one. And maybe update this a bit more regularly.

First for the personal updates - I've begun a new role as a Software Engineer at Canon USA. Well, I've been in that role for over half a year now, and I'm very happy with the opportunities challenges it provides me. Truthfully, I also genuinely enjoyed my previous job over at Endeavor, but I wanted to pivot from QA/SDET over to Software Engineering. And that has been an absolute pleasure - from building an interesting product to joining a very skilled and welcoming team - I couldn't be happier.


Now onto plans moving forward - I very much plan on getting back into more personal projects. I suppose this redesign (which is itself still a work in progress) counts as one, but I want to take a deeper dive into harder projects. Specifically,I wanted to take a look at languages and frameworks I'm not the most familiar with. I've worked on many smaller scale projects in my spare time, and I want to revisit some of the lower level languages and the challenges that come with them. Node is great for creating a project nice and quick, but, the amount of abstraction it gives you can ultimately limit you and how much you learn. Additionally, the lack of multithreading does lead to an inherent problem with concurrency - namely, how does one actually do it? There's the obvious solution of using a Process Manager, which I've actually worked with before. There's another soluion of simply scaling horizontally. But realistically, I'd prefer to keep any infrastructure costs to a minimum, if not within free tier entirely for personal projects. So for my next project, I'd like to use a lower level language with better tools for concurrency, some obvious frameworks that support your basic necessities (ie creating REST APIs). And ideally, it's a language I've not yet worked with. Quite the list of requirements. I wonder which one I will Go with.


In any case, I'll be posting updates on any personal projects here more regularly.
